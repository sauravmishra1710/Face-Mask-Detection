# Face-Mask-Detection

With the Covid-19 Pandemic, wearing of the face masks have become mandatory across the globe. Thus, an AI application that would enable the automatic detection if a person is wearing mask / or not will be beneficial in areas such as auto-controlled (unmanned) entry gates at various places. A camera based application could flag-off persons not wearing mask and thus not allowing entry. This can be put to use in shopping malls, shops, cinema theatres, stadiums, indoor arena, gyms where social distancing and basic precautionary measures are very much essestial to be followed. A camera could be deployed at the entrance door and any one not wearing a mask will not be allowed entry (automatic door does not open).
